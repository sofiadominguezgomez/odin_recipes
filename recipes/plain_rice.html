            <li> Some oil and salt </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Steps</p>

            <li>First, chop the garlic and the onion into tiny pieces</li>
            <li>Add a teablespoon of oil to a pot and turn the heat on, then the chopped garlic and onion</li>
            <li>When the onion looks sort of transparent, add the rice and combine thoroughly</li>
