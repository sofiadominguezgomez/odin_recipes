            <ol> 1 onion </ol>
            <ol> Some oil and salt </ol>
        </ul>
        <p>Steps</p>
        <ul>
            <ol>First, chop the garlic and the onion into tiny pieces</ol>
            <ol>Add a teablespoon of oil to a pot and turn the heat on, then the chopped garlic and onion</ol>
            <ol>When the onion looks sort of transparent, add the rice and combine thoroughly</ol>
